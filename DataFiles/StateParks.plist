		<string>Within sight of downtown Miami, yet worlds away, Biscayne protects a rare combination of aquamarine waters, emerald islands, and fish-bejeweled coral reefs. Here too is evidence of 10,000 years of human history, from pirates and shipwrecks to pineapple farmers and presidents. Outdoors enthusiasts can boat, snorkel, camp, watch wildlife…or simply relax in a rocking chair gazing out over the bay.</string>

Many sought religious freedom in a new land, while others were soldiers or tradesmen starting a new life.  The climactic battles fought here between the French and Spanish marked the first time that European nations fought for control of lands in what is now the United States.  It would not be the last time. </string>
